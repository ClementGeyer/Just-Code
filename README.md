JustCode is an AI-powered VSCode code commenting tool for vanilla JavaScript and ReactJS projects.
It can generate JSDoc compatible comments.

## Features

Currently, this extension offers two features, one free and one premium.
More features will be coming regularly.

### Generate single line comment

This first feature is able to generate a detailed explanation of the line below.
To activate this feature, you only need to type '// ' and the extension will take the context
and generate the comment.
